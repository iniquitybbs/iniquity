## Introduction

### Some guidng thoughts surrounding the idea of a new Iniquity BBS

-   A BBS software that is geared towards developers and modders.
-   Make it easy for sysops to develop and deploy BBS applications.
-   Easily network files, messages and other forms of communication between other BBS applications.
-   What you see in xterm, NetRunner, SyncTerm, EtherTerm or qodem is what you see in a web browser.
    -   Though the ability to do interesting things specific to terminal/web should exist.

## Getting started

### Your development environment should contain something like this, or similar

-   macOS / Windows / Linux _required_
    -   These modern operating systems are currently supported.
-   Docker Desktop for macOS / Windows or Docker Machine _required_
    -   The Iniquity BBS runtime is executed inside of a Docker container for portability.
-   Node.js & NPM _required_
    -   The Node community tools are used for TypeScript transpiling and Iniquity package management.
-   Visual Studio Code _recommended_
    -   This repository is specifically tuned to take full advantage of this IDE.
-   Moebius _recommended_
    -   The ideal choice for working with ANSI/ASCII/PETSCII/AMIGA artwork.

### First, clone this repository somewhere on your system

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iniquitybbs/iniquity.git
```

## Inside of the iniquity directory, install the project dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

## Start iniquity

```bash
npm start
```

### Developing an iniquity bbs application

This project is designed to be modified using Visual Studio Code. There are recomended settings and plugins for its development that come as part of this repository that Visual Studio Code will make available to you. You should install all of these plugins! The main directory you will work out of is your app/ directory. This is where your BBS logic exists. You can safely ignore all directories outside of the app/ directory for now.

Below you'll find some examples of what could be achieved with iniquity right now. It's not much, but it's a start and fun to play with...

#### An example welcome experience for connecting users

```typescript
const bbs = new Iniquity()

const welcomeArt = bbs.artwork({ filename: "assets/sm!iniq2.ans" })
welcomeArt.render({ clearScreenBefore: true, speed: 100 })

bbs.say(
    `You just connected to an iniquity bbs. The artwork you are seeing above is called ${welcomeArt.filename} It's still pretty new. Likely has bugs. Real talk; it's not even finished. But maybe you'll still think it's cool.`
        .newlines()
        .color("background red")
        .center()
).pause({ colorReset: true, newlines: 2, center: true })
```

#### Have it present some larger artwork, and end with prompting the user to pause

```typescript
bbs.artwork({ filename: "packages/core/assets/we-iniq3.ans" }).render({ clearScreenBefore: false }).pause({ newlines: 2, center: true })
```

#### Begin to describe a simple login or new user application process

```typescript
function loginMenu(): void {
    bbs.artwork({ filename: "assets/artwork/4d-iniq1.ans" }).render({ speed: 100 })
    const login = bbs.ask("What is your login: ")
    switch (login) {
        case "new":
        case "signup":
            bbs.artwork({ filename: "assets/newuser.ans" }).render({ clearScreenBefore: true })

            let newUser = bbs.user({
                name: bbs.ask("What would you like your handle to be?".newlines(2).color("white")),
                password: bbs.ask("And your password?".newlines(2).color("white"))
            })

            bbs.say(`Welcome ${newUser.name}. And goodbye!`.newlines().center())
            loginMenu()
            break
        default:
            if (bbs.user({ name: login, password: bbs.ask("And your password?".newlines(2).color("white")) })) {
                bbs.say("You exist in the system!")
            }

            bbs.artwork({ filename: "assets/artwork/4d-iniq1.ans" }).render({ clearScreenBefore: true })
            break
    }
}
```
