# Eternity

Hey there, if you're digging the classic BBS vibe, you're gonna love the Eternity template for Iniquity 3. Think of it as a throwback to the original Iniquity feel but, you know, revamped. It's basically Iniquity 1's style, but with a fresh twist. The cherry on top? Eternity boasts a diverse collection of both ANSI and ASCII artwork. Not only do we have those iconic pieces from the original Iniquity days, but there's also a range of art contributed by some seriously talented folks from various art groups over the years. Itâ€™s like a visual history of the BBS art scene. Pretty neat for those who appreciate both code and creativity, right? ðŸŽ¨
