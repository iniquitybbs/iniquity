# Iniquity Archive

This is where we can put all the old Iniquity stuff. Do some cool stuff with it. Make it accessible to iniquity bbs developers.

## Synposis

I'm thinking this is like, Iniquity's built in backpack.

- Filled with all kinds of random ansi, ascii, whatever _textmode_ files.
- Maybe eventually it could also do some processing on these files by way of some of Synchronet's lower level text file utils. Hmm...

## Install

### NPM

    npm install -g @iniquitybbs/archive
